Hydrogen (or other pure gas phase species) depressurization calculations

## Background
This is a small spare time project for calculation of vessel depressurisation behaviour. This is mainly to demonstrate, that although perceived as a very tedious/difficult task to write your own code for such an apparent complex problem, actually a fairly limited amount of code is necessary if you have a good thermodynamic backend. 

A few choices is made to keep things simple to begin with:

- Coolprop is used as thermodynamic backend
- Only pure substances are considered
- Gas phase only
- Heat transfer is modelled as simple as possible

Code will be as simple as possible - a single file to start with - no fancy module structure, no GUI, nothing - just a simple script with an input file.
These choices make the problem a lot more simple to solve, First of all the the pure substance Helmholtz energy based equation of state in coolprop offers a lot of convenience in terms of the property pairs/state variables that can be set independently. Using only a single gas phase species also means that component balances is redundant and 2 or 3-phase flash calculations are not required. That being said the principle used for a single component is more or less the same, even for multicomponent mixtures with potentially more than one phase.

Over time the code could evolve to implement the Stefan-Bolzmann fire duty equation as described in e.g. API521 / Scandpower guideline, pressure relief valve instead of blow down valve, pressurisation behaviour etc.

## Description
The following methods are implemented:

- Isothermal i.e. constant tmeperature of the fluid during depressurisation (for a very slow process with a large heat reservoir)
- Isenthalpic/Adiabatic (no heat transfer with surroundings, no work performed by the expanding fluid)
- Isentropic (no heat transfer with surroundings, PV work performed by the expanding fluid)
- Constant internal energy
- Energy balance, this is the most general case, and includes both the ability to transfer heat with surroundings as well as PV work is accounted for (PV work efficiency can be specied, but 100% or close to is recommended)

## Basic usage
The Yaml input file is edited to reflect the system of interest. For isothermal/isenthalpic/isentropic/isenergetic calculations the minimal input required are:

- Initial conditions (pressure, temperature)
- vessel dimensions (ID/length)
- valve parameters (Cd, diameter, backpressure)
- Calculation setup (time step, end time)
- Type of gas

If heat transfer is to be considered the calculation type "energybalance" is required. A few options are possible:

- Fixed U (U-value required, and ambient temperature)
- Fixed Q (Q to be applied to the fluid is requried)
- Specified h, the external heat transfer coefficient is provided and either the internal is provided or calculated from assumption of natural convection from a vertical cylinder at high Gr number. Ambient temperature is required.
- Detailed (not yet implememted)
- Fire (Not yet implemented)

## Validation
The code is mainly for demonstration, and is provided as-is. However, a comparison has been made to experiment I1 from Haque et al. (see full ref below). The results are shown below.

## Requirements

- [Python](http://www.python.org) (3.8 - at least python3)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Coolprop (6.4.1)](http://www.coolprop.org/)
- Yaml 

The script is running on Windows 10 x64, with stock python installation from python.org and packages installed using pip. Should run om linux or in any conda environment as well, but I haven't checked.

## TO-DO
- Addition of heat transfer correlations for different geometries and also considering mixed convection
- Fire heat load using Stefan-Boltzmann equation as per API521/Scandpower guideline
- Vessel loading/filling
- Relief valve (spring loaded) as an alternative to orifice depressurisation
- Additional plots
- More description
