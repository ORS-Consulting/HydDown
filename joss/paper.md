The making of this project would not have possible without the great [CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org/) library [@doi:10.1021/ie4033999]. I am also thankful for enlightning discussions with colleague Jacob Gram Iskov Eriksen (Ramboll Energy, Denmark) and former Ramboll Energy colleague Carsten Stegelmann (ORS Consulting) in relation to vessel depressurisation, nozzle flow and heat transfer considerations. This work has also befitted significantly from the understanding of thermo mechanical pressure vessel behaviour obtained in previous works [@Bjerre2017],[@safety4010011],[@iskov].
